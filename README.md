# Welcome

Amber is a web development framework written in Crystal which implements the server-side MVC pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python's Django.

The AMber cookbook is an openly developed and community editable documentation project. Notice the pencil icon button fixated against the right wall; it will direct you to the GitHub online editor of the active page, allowing you to contribute any additions, deletions, or corrections to the documentation.

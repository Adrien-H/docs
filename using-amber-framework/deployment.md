# Deployment

Supported Distributions: Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04

May build on: Raspbian

2gb of RAM with 512MB swap is required to compile. 3gb or more is recommended.

Swap files can be used on low RAM servers for a longer but one-time compilation.

Crystal itself is low-RAM usage and powerful servers are not typically needed.

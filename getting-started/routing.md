# Routing

Routing provides you tools that map URLs to controller actions. By defining routes, you can separate how your application is implemented from how its URLâ€™s are structured, Routes wire up real-time web socket handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.

### Pipelines

A _pipeline_ is a set of of transformations that is performed to a HTTP request. These transformations come in the form of a pipe. A _pipe_ is a** **class which includes [`HTTP::Handler`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.22.0/HTTP/Handler.html) and implements the [`#call`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.22.0/HTTP/Handler.html#call%28context%3AHTTP%3A%3AServer%3A%3AContext%29-instance-method) method. You can use a handler to intercept any incoming request and modify the response. These can be used for request throttling, ip-based whitelisting, adding custom headers.

Every Amber application needs to define a _pipeline_ with a set of _pipes_ each pipeline allow a set of transformations to be applied to different sets of route, this give you granular control and explicitness of which transformation to run for each of the requests.

```crystal
pipeline :web do
  plug Amber::Pipe::Logger.new
  plug HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new "../examples/public", false
  plug HTTP::CompressHandler.new
end
```

Above we define a pipeline called `:web` as you can see the `:web` pipeline transforms the request using a _Logger_, _StaticFileHandler_ and a _CompressHandler_, all of which extends from the Crystal [_HTTP::Handler_](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.22.0/HTTP/Handler.html) class.

Amber provides us some default pipelines for a number of common tasks. In turn we can customize them as well as create new pipelines to meet our needs.

* **Pipe::Static** serves static assets

* **Pipe::Logger** logs incoming requests

* **Pipe::CodeReload** enables code reloading for all entries in the web directory.

* **Pipe::CORS** Handler adds support for Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

* **Pipe::CSRF** Handler adds support for Cross Site Request Forgery.

* **Pipe::Error** Handler catches RouteNotFound and returns.

* **Pipe::Flash** handler provides a mechanism to pass flash message between

* **Pipe::Session** a plug that sets up session management.

With our `:web` pipeline now define we can use it in our routes dinfitions

### Routes

A route connects a HTTP request to an action inside a controller. When your Amber application receives an incoming request for:  `GET /users/24` it asks the Amber router to match it to a controller action. it the router finds a match `get users/:id, UsersController, :index` the request is dispatched to the UsersController.index action with { id: 24 } in the params hash.

The **routes** macro accepts a _pipeline_ name and a \_scope, \_in which all routes define within this block will make use of the pipeline and the url will be scoped.

Lets say you are defining a static website and you want all your URL to be displayed as `http://www.mycoolsite.com/page` you will define your routes as:

```ruby
# routes(pipeline, scope)
routes :web, "/page"
```

The routes macro takes a last argument, a \_block, \_within the block is where you define your routes.

```ruby
routes :web, '/static' do
  get "/about", StaticController, :about
end
```

Mapping the above route

| Http Method | Resource | Controller | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| get | "/about" | StaticController | :about |

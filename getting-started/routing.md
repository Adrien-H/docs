# Routes

Routing provides you tools that map URLs to controller actions. By defining routes, you can separate how your application is implemented from how its URLâ€™s are structured, Routes wire up real-time web socket handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.

```ruby
Amber::Server.instance.config do |app|
  pipeline :web do
    # Plug is the method to use connect a pipe (middleware)
    # A plug accepts an instance of HTTP::Handler
    # plug Amber::Pipe::Params.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::Logger.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::Flash.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::Session.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::CSRF.new
  end

  # All static content will run these transformations
  pipeline :static do
    plug HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new("./public")
    plug HTTP::CompressHandler.new
  end

  routes :static do
    # Each route is defined as follow
    # verb resource : String, controller : Symbol, action : Symbol
    get "/*", StaticController, :index
  end

  routes :web do
    get "/", HomeController, :index
  end

  routes :api, "/api" do
    get "/", ApiController, :index
  end

end
```

A route connects a HTTP request to an action inside a controller. When your Amber application receives an incoming request for:  `GET /users/24` it asks the Amber router to match it to a controller action. it the router finds a match `get users/:id, UsersController, :index` the request is dispatched to the UsersController.index action with { id: 24 } in the params hash.

The **routes** macro accepts a _pipeline_ name and a \_scope, \_in which all routes define within this block will make use of the pipeline and the url will be scoped.

Lets say you are defining a static website and you want all your URL to be displayed as `http://www.mycoolsite.com/page` you will define your routes as:

```ruby
# routes(pipeline, scope)
routes :web, "/page"
```

The routes macro takes a last argument, a \_block, \_within the block is where you define your routes.

```ruby
routes :web, '/static' do
  get "/about", StaticController, :about
end
```

Mapping the above route

| Http Method | Resource | Controller | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| get | "/about" | StaticController | :about |

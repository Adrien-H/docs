# Routing

Routing provides you tools that map URLs to controller actions. By defining routes, you can separate how your application is implemented from how its URLâ€™s are structured, Routes wire up real-time web socket handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.

### Pipelines

Every Amber application needs to define a pipeline with a set of pipes each pipeline allow a set of middleware transformations to be applied to different sets of route, this give you granular control and explicitness of which transformation to run for each of the app requests.

```ruby
# All api scoped routes will run these transformations
pipeline :web do
  # Plug is the method to use connect a pipe (middleware)
  # A plug accepts an instance of HTTP::Handler
  plug Amber::Pipe::Logger.new
  plug HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new "../examples/public", false
  plug HTTP::CompressHandler.new
end
```

Above we define a pipeline called `:web` as you can see this `:web` pipeline transforms the request using a _Logger_, _StaticFileHandler_ and a _CompressHandler_, all of which extends from the Crystal [_HTTP::Handler_](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.22.0/HTTP/Handler.html) class, A handler is a class which includes [`HTTP::Handler`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.22.0/HTTP/Handler.html) and implements the [`#call`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.22.0/HTTP/Handler.html#call%28context%3AHTTP%3A%3AServer%3A%3AContext%29-instance-method) method. You can use a handler to intercept any incoming request and can modify the response. These can be used for request throttling, ip-based whitelisting, adding custom headers e.g.

With our `:web` pipeline now define we can use it in our routes.

### Routes

A route connects a HTTP request to an action inside a controller. When your Amber application receives an incoming request for:  `GET /users/24` it asks the Amber router to match it to a controller action. it the router finds a match `get users/:id, UsersController, :index` the request is dispatched to the UsersController.index action with { id: 24 } in the params hash.

The **routes** macro accepts a pipeline name and a scope. Lets say you are defining a static website and you want your URL to be displayed as `http://www.mycoolsite.com/page/about` you will define your routes as:

```ruby
routes :web, '/static' do
  get "/about", StaticController, :about
end
```

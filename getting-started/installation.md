# Deploying Amber on Heroku

If you haven't done so please read the guides to install the [Amber CLI](/getting-started/installation/heroku.md)

## Heroku

If you have generated your project with the Amber CLI and successfully run it locally we are now at a point where we can create an application on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). If you haven't yet done it, create an account on Heroku and install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).
